# Overview

In this project, I developed a Library Catalog System using C# to deepen my understanding of core programming concepts. The goal was to create a functional system that allows users to manage a collection of books by adding, borrowing, returning, and viewing available books. Additionally, I wanted to practice file handling in C# by implementing persistent storage, which saves the data of the library to a file so it can be reloaded later.

# Development Environment

- Visual Studio Code
- .NET Core SDK
- C#

# Future Work

- Add a feature to search for books by title or author more efficiently.
